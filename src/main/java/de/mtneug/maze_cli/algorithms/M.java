/**
 * This maze generation algorithm tries to generate mazes with different difficulty levels by dividing the cells into a
 * passable and a non passable set. The sizes and the generation of the sets depends on the chosen difficulty level.
 * While the passable set can always the thought of a connected graph, the non passable set could be disconnected.
 * <p/>
 * In a second and third step a maze generation algorithm - in this case Prim - is run for the passable and non passable
 * set. For a human solver it so seems probably possible to reach every cell, while in fact the correct path is directed
 * through the passable set.
 * <p/>
 * This algorithm was developed by Matthias Neugebauer during the seminar "Procedural Content generation in Games" at
 * the University of MÃ¼nster in the summer semester 2015. To which degree this method can fulfill the set goal, can be
 * read in the essay for this seminar.
